# Notebooks

Here you can find many documents I've written across the years in order to learn a number of subjects. Some of them correspond to lecture notes I've written before teaching a course or a seminar, some were study notebooks written just for the sake of it and could be useful for someone, some were the lecture notes I took (and typed) while watching a course. Some of these are in Portuguese and some are in English. I chose to leave the descriptions in agreement with the project's language. Notice most titles are hyperlinks to the pdfs. The documents not currently available are absent due to some personal reason, but I might be willing to share some of them upon request.

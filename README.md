I work as a research assistant in the Quantum Field Theory and Gravitation Group, with some big interest in the interface between Quantum Information and Gravitation, i am currently also an aspiring data scientist.

This is my personal/professional website. In here you will find a number of informations and documents concerning what i studied throughout my carreer in Physics and data science, since my early days, and also links I find interesting, webpages from researchers I admire, and so on.
